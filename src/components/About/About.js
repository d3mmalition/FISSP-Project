            <h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>It is essential to the proper conduct and operation of Friends of Ichetucknee Springs State Park
                        (herein “CSO”) that its board members, officers, and employees be independent and impartial and
                        that their position not be used for private gain. Therefore, the Florida Legislature in Section 112.3251,
                        Florida Statute (Fla. Stat.), requiresthat the law protect against any conflict of interest and establish
                        standards for the conduct of CSO board members, officers, and employees in situations where
                        conflicts may exist.
                    </li>
                    <li> It is hereby declared to be the policy of the state that no CSO board member, officer, or employee
                        shall have any interest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or incur any obligation of any
                        nature which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his or her duties for the CSO.
                        To implement this policy and strengthen the faith and confidence of the people in Citizen Support
                        Organizations, there is enacted a code of ethics setting forth standards of conduct required of
                        Friends of Ichetucknee Springs State Park board members, officers, and employees in the
                        performance of their official duties.
